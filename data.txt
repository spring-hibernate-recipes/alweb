<li>Based on LFS systemd and BLFS systemd development versions.</li>
<li>Arya in all DEs listed in BLFS and also Mate. Mate actually is undergoing some serious work of late so need to catch up with that.</li>
<li>I have created a lot of extra scripts that would be tested and eventually uploaded for download. As of now the LFS, X-Server and Mate Scripts are pretty stable. Would share them soon.</li>
<li>A lot of work is in progress to get a nice bootsplash going during the boot process. Hopefully would succeed in getting either one of Splashy or Plymouth integrated into the boot system.</li>
<li>Far more refined and stable desktop compared to the previous versions. Of course we would not disturb the existing integrity by making more changes but things would definitely be more stable.</li>
<li>Blueman is back with version 2.0 and bluez5. It was dropped off BLFS a version or so back because Blueman was incompatible with bluez5. A few days back, did build both on Mate and things just worked, yet need to test it though.</li>
<li>Generic kernel to ensure most systems would be able to run AryaLinux - x86 and x86_64 of course.</li>
<li>LFS part builds a little faster in multi core systems and by incorporation of ccache building other stuff becomes a little faster as well (llvm, kernel etc.)</li>
<li>Initramfs support. This sould have been like there, no questions asked. My bad. Took some time, but initramfs support, yes of course.</li>
<li>Package version would by and large be the same as in the LFS and BLFS books.</li>

There has been a lot of updates both on the LFS and BLFS front and on our front as well. The next release - 2016.04 would be out by the end of April 2016. Excited about this release because a lot of thinking has gone into this release and lot changes can be expected.', 'Thank you all for your support!<p>Its been quiet a while and LFS and BLFS have both moved ahead. There had been very few updates because most of the work that was happening kept me so involved that I was finding little time to make updates. With this release, in fact a whole lot of new things, refinements and process streamlining is going to happen. But before I give a preview of the same, here&#39;s something that has happened of late:</p><ul>
<li>We got listed in distrowatch. Visit <a href="distrowatch.com/arya">distrowatch.com/arya</a> for more details. I know our distrowatch profile looks pretty deserted as of now, but things would surely improve with time.</li>
<li>Of late I realized a lot of things, of course the hard way which could have been taken care of in the previous versions of AryaLinux but errors simply happened because, the whole Linux landscape is so dynamic and changes so fast that its diffiult to keep up. Things like being able to be boot on most machines(if not all), error free builds, correctness and validity of instructions in the articles etc could have been much better and improved. Well, the good part is, have solved a lot of such issues and you could see that in the next release which would be out within the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Arya does not have a fixed release cycle which I think is not a good thing at all so, in order to take care of that soon would be putting a road map in the website and would strictly adhere to the same.</li>
<li>I would also be sharing stuff that I am currently working on so that beta testing and bug fixes can be done swiflty and this would be done on a regular basis.</li>
I guess that&#39;s that and, well, watch out for the next release! Have fun building!!

A few years back only after reuniting with Rakesh Khandelwal(Creator and Maintainer of <a href=\"prathamos.org\">Pratham OS</a>), a very old and dear friend of the good old school days that I shared my idea of building a distro around scripts, inspired by LFS. He encouraged me to build and release the scripts that I had worked on over the years but there was another challange. LFS sort of helps you build a usable GNU/Linux Desktop but you would still need to build/install a lot of things on your own outside the LFS/BLFS ecospace to end up with a really working OS worthy of running alongside or even replacing any existing system for that matter. Painstkingly, we worked through a lot of minor details - Hardware Driver Issues, Circular Package Dependencies, Package Management System etc and here we are.', 'Chandrakant', now(), 1, '');
